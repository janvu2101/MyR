# LOAD LIBRARIES

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(rio)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
```

# EXERCISE 1: REPLICATE FIGURE 4
## Load the dataset

```{r}
data_original <- rio::import("data/pub_pvt_scatters.dta")
uniid <- rio::import("data/univ_names.xlsx")
```

## Merge data

## Create a common deflator

## Create the real value of the appropriation

## Differentiate public and private university

## Reorder data by unit and by year

## Create log of variable

## Create difference in log values by university between 2005 and 2012

## Replicate Figure 4

# EXERCISE 2: REPLICATE TABLE 2

## Load the dataset

## Create variable for total state appropriation of all other universities within the same state

## Find the balanced sample

## Run the regression from table 2





```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
